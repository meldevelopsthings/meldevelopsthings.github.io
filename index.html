        <p class="text-fill sm:text-3xl sm:p-10 p-6 text-2xl">My name is Melody Gannon and I am a computer science student at Sheffield Hallam University. I have also previously studied computer science at lower levels throughout both high school and college, so I do have a good few years of experience behind me! <br><br> Despite this however, I believe I have only truly “blossomed” as a developer during my university course due to a much higher level of understanding and experience, allowing me to have much more confidence and proficiency to get behind bigger and more ambitious projects. <br><br> Needless to say, I look forward to populating this website with more showcases in the future, hopefully showing a nice timeline of my progress!</p>

            <p class="text-fill text-2xl mt-8 pb-10 px-6 ">Since focusing more on web development in university, I wanted to learn how to make my websites look a lot nicer. After asking around, I landed on trying Tailwind CSS and have been using it since, helping to save time with styling websites.</p>

A much needed change to help with development across multiple machines with differing versions.</p>

            <p class="text-fill sm:text-[32px] text-2xl sm:p-10 p-6">Clairvoyance is a task management software that I designed for my university course. It is a web application made using a simple stack of HTML, Tailwind CSS, PHP and Javascript. The app uses a drag and drop functionality to allow for the sorting of tasks between multiple different lists at a time, under a kanban board view which can allow users to monitor their progress incrementally. <br><br> The main features are defined primarily by CRUD, allowing the user to interact with the app and its database through an authentication system. This system requires users to sign up to the app before they use it, but allows a lot of options for task management for anyone who does.</p>

This software was required to be a CRUD application that could function on an Intranet, which would allow the agency to manage their properties, landlords and tenants and all information regarding them. This would include things like a tenants rental data, like how much rent they have paid. <br><br> In the end, iLet4You was happy with what we provided in the end. We were even chosen by our university to showcase it at an event!</p>
