    <div class="mx-50 mt-20 bg-lilac rounded-2xl text-center shadow-md">
        <p class="text-fill text-[32px] p-10">My name is Melody Gannon and I am a computer science student at Sheffield Hallam University. I have also previously studied computer science at lower levels throughout both high school and college, so I do have a good few years of experience behind me! <br><br> Despite this however, I believe I have only truly “blossomed” as a developer during my university course due to a much higher level of understanding and experience, allowing me to have much more confidence and proficiency to get behind bigger and more ambitious projects. <br><br> Needless to say, I look forward to populating this website with more showcases in the future, hopefully showing a nice timeline of my progress!</p>

            <h1 class="text-5xl mt-12">Tailwind CSS</h1>
            <p class="text-2xl mt-8 pb-10 px-6">Since focusing more on web development in university, I wanted to learn how to make my websites look a lot nicer. After asking around, I landed on trying Tailwind CSS and have been using it since, helping to save time with styling websites.</p>

            <h1 class="text-5xl mt-12">C#</h1>
            <p class="text-2xl mt-8 pb-10 px-6">I have been using C# since around 2021 as I picked it up during college. I have a good amount of experience in using this language and am comfortable with object oriented programming.</p>

            <h1 class="text-5xl mt-12">PHP</h1>
            <p class="text-2xl mt-8 pb-10 px-6">A very useful tool for interactions between a website and a database hosted on it, especially for larger scale projects. This technology has been used in most of my university projects.</p>

        <div class="bg-lilac rounded-2xl shadow-md w-155 ">
            <h1 class="text-5xl mt-12">Git</h1>
            <p class="text-2xl mt-8 pb-10 px-6">Collaboration and general cloud management is difficult without the correct tools, so I learned Git for university when group work was required more. A much needed change to help with development across multiple machines with differing versions.</p>

            <h1 class="text-5xl mt-12">Javascript</h1>
            <p class="text-2xl mt-8 pb-10 px-6">Another very useful technology for websites, allowing dynamically updating content without the refreshing of the site itself. You can see this for yourself in this website with the different themes!</p>

        <div class="mx-50 mt-20 bg-lilac rounded-2xl text-center shadow-md">
            <p class="text-fill text-[32px] p-10">Clairvoyance is a task management software that I designed for my university course. It is a web application made using a simple stack of HTML, Tailwind CSS, PHP and Javascript. The app uses a drag and drop functionality to allow for the sorting of tasks between multiple different lists at a time, under a kanban board view which can allow users to monitor their progress incrementally. <br><br> The main features are defined primarily by CRUD, allowing the user to interact with the app and its database through an authentication system. This system requires users to sign up to the app before they use it, but allows a lot of options for task management for anyone who does.</p>

            <p class="text-fill text-[32px] p-10">iLet4You is a letting agency based in Sheffield who, through my university course, tasked a group of us to collaborate and create a CRM system for them using C# and Winforms. This software was required to be a CRUD application that could function on an Intranet, which would allow the agency to manage their properties, landlords and tenants and all information regarding them. This would include things like a tenants rental data, like how much rent they have paid. <br><br> In the end, iLet4You was happy with what we provided in the end. We were even chosen by our university to showcase it at an event!</p>
