        <p class="text-fill text-[32px] p-10">My name is Melody Gannon and I am a computer science student at Sheffield Hallam University. I have also previously studied computer science at lower levels throughout both high school and college, so I do have a good few years of experience behind me! <br><br> Despite this however, I believe I have only truly “blossomed” as a developer during my university course due to a much higher level of understanding and experience, allowing me to have much more confidence and proficiency to get behind bigger and more ambitious projects. <br><br> Needless to say, I look forward to populating this website with more showcases in the future, hopefully showing a nice timeline of my progress!</p>

            <h1 class="text-4xl">Tailwind CSS</h1>
            <p class="text-2xl">Since focusing more on web development in university, I wanted to learn how to make my websites look a lot nicer. After asking around, I landed on trying Tailwind CSS and have been using it since. It proves useful by saving a lot of time by simply just letting me write html classes for CSS styling, instead of having to have a seperate file open and switching back and forth each time I want to edit the style.</p>
